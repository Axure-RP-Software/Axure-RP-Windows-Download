## 🧠 Overview

**Axure RP** is a professional Windows application designed for creating highly detailed UX prototypes and interaction specifications. It enables designers to model not only how interfaces look, but also how they behave under real user conditions.

The tool supports logic-driven interactions, dynamic panels, variables, and conditional flows, making it possible to simulate complex application behavior without programming. This allows teams to validate ideas, test scenarios, and communicate functionality clearly before development begins.

Axure RP is commonly used in enterprise and large-scale product design projects where clarity and precision are critical. Its structured approach makes it especially effective for documenting requirements and aligning designers, stakeholders, and developers on Windows platforms.
